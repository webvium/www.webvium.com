              Webvium did not begin as a browser project. It began as a way to
              learn Android development. The first version was called WebView,
              named after the component it was built on, and it did little more
              than load a page and display it.
            </Reveal>
            <Reveal as="p" delay={120}>
              Features were then added one at a time. For a long stretch there
              was no real goal beyond making it work, whatever the cost to size,
              and the app kept growing heavier with each addition.
            </Reveal>
            <Reveal as="p" delay={180}>
              The rewrite that became Webvium, short for WebView and Chromium,
              is where the goal finally became clear: make it as light and as
              fast as possible, so it runs well even on low end devices. Every
              change since has been measured against that.

              I started this while teaching myself Java and Android, first on a
              phone with AIDE and later on my first laptop with Android Studio.
              WebView was the project I built to learn, and it slowly turned
              into something I actually wanted to use.

              It has stayed a small, independent effort by choice. There is no
              team to feed and no roadmap dictated by anyone else, which means
              the only real pressure is to keep the software good.

              If something feels slow, heavy, or confusing, that is a bug worth
              fixing. That standard has not changed since the rewrite.
